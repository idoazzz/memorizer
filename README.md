# **Memorizer**
`Based on Datamuse api `<br>
Help people that struggle to 
remember new english words, based on associative memory method. <br>
There are a lot of methods, tricks and ways to learn new english words. 
<br>Memorizer takes your new word  and suggest you similar soundlike words that are **known** to you.
<br>Now, you have only one job. Bound the words that Memorizer suggested you, and the new associative soundlike words.
<br>
<br>
### Example
`You can specify if auto-split should perform, or you will split your word to parts alone.`
* **SEARCH** your target word. 
    * `bargain` 
* **PICK** the most associative words to each part of your word. 
    * `bar game`.
* **BOUND** your association to the new word! We know by the displayed definitions that bargain is negotiation of terms -
    * `Every time you will negotiate you have to start with bar game. Without it you will lose!`

Now, we will remember what is bargain! (hopefully)
