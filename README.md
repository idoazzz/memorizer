### Example
* **Search** your target word. 
    * `bargain` 
* **Pick** the most associative words to each part of your word. 
    * `bar game`.
* **Bound** your association to the new word! We know by the displayed definitions that bargain is negotiation of terms -
    * `Every time you will negotiate you have to start with bar game. Without it you will lose!`

Now, we will remember what is bargain! (hopefully)
